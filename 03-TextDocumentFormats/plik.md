# Social Media

Social media are new media technologies that facilitate the creation, sharing and aggregation of content (such as ideas, interests, and other forms of expression) amongst virtual communities and networks.  Common features include:
* Online platforms enable users to create and share content and participate in social networking.
* User-generated contentâ€”such as text posts or comments, digital photos or videos, and data generated through online interactions.
* Service-specific profiles that are designed and maintained by the social media organization.
* Social media helps the development of online social networks by connecting a user's profile with those of other individuals or groups.

## Criticism, debate and controversy

Criticisms include platform capabilities, content moderation and reliability, impact on concentration, mental health, content ownership, and the meaning of interactions, and poor cross-platform interoperability, decrease in face-to-face interactions, cyberbullying, sexual predation, particularly of children, and child pornography.

>In 2007 Andrew Keen wrote, "Out of this anarchy, it suddenly became clear that what was governing the infinite monkeys now inputting away on the Internet was the law of digital Darwinism, the survival of the loudest and most opinionated. Under these rules, the only way to intellectually prevail is by infinite filibustering.
